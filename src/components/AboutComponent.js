          Since beginning my journey as a competitive coder one year ago, I've
          gained a lot of expirience in practical problem solving. Then I dived
          into web developing as it make me curious to work on interface with
          which I can help other with my problem solving ability. I'm quietly
          confident, naturally curious, and perpetually working on improving my
          problem solving ability at a time.{' '}
